Machine Learning Engineer
Rabobank | Amsterdam
 - 
Enterprise-scale fraud detection system (executes +1M data points weekly|large-scale machine learning model)
Reduced false positive alerts by 32% through optimization of MoE-based Financial Crime classification model, saving
accounting team 20 hours weekly, creating immediate and long-term business value
Reduced model training costs by 230K annually by optimizing data processing pipeline (58% efficiency gain), feature
exploration, and improving data quality with weekly rather than monthly model/data analysis updates, improving
model trust and safety ratings
Implemented MLOps coding practices (automated retraining, drift detection, active learning, CI/CD pipeline, full
productionisation), increased deployment frequency by 400% and enabled the team to deliver 7 features
